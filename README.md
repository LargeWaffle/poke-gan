 Generative Adversarial Network for Pokemon image generation
 
 I merged and processed multiple Kaggle datasets in order to have as much as possible.  
 You can find this dataset here : [Massive Pokemon Dataset (15,000+)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomassirvent/all-pokemon)  
 
 This codes expects a *data* folder where your dataset is present.  
 However, some models are already present and can be run with the **inference.py** file
